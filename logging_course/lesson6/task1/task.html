In previous tasks we have manually configured logging objects and we have used basicConfig().
<br>
<br>
You can also load logging configuration from a file using "logging.fileConfig()". This function takes the
filename of a ConfigParser based file.
<br>
<br>
For the purpose of this course, we are going to write this file from the task code. In normal circumstances, you
would maintain this configuration data in a separate file.
<br>
<br>
Every logging config file needs to have the following sections: [loggers], [formatters] and [handlers]
<br>
<br>
Each section needs a name specified "keys". The value could be one or more additional configuration sections
you have to create. And each of those is going to contain name/value pairs based on the type of section.
<br>
<br>
In the next few tasks we are going to explain this one small step at a time
<br>
<br>
In this first task, we need to identify an instance name for a Formatter type object. Use the name "formatter1"
in this task, although the name is an arbitrary identifier. You just have to use the same whenever you reference
the same object.
<br>
<br>
Notice under the "[formatter_formatter1]" section there is another key/value pair for "format". This is the
format string we have encountered in previous tasks. This is used to initialize the "formatter1" instance.
