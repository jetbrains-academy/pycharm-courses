In this task we will configure our root Logger instance. This is done using the instance name "root".
<br>
<br>
Under the "[logger_root]" section we need to configure additional key/values to complete the instance configuration:
<br>
<br>
"handlers" is a list of key names for each instance of a handler we want to add to this Logger instance.
<br>
<br>
"level" is the log severity level
