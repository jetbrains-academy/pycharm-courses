Logger names can form a named hierarchy. This allows you to selectively enable log messages at
any point in this hierarchy. You can create a new branch in the namespace by separating the logger instance name with periods.

Example hierarchy with the corresponding getLogger() call:

ROOT                                        logging.getLogger()
   |
   +-- "a"                                  logging.getLogger("a")
   |    |
   |    +-- "a1"                            logging.getLogger("a.a1")
   |    |    |
   |    |    +-- "aaa"                      logging.getLogger("a.a1.aaa")
   |    |    |
   |    |    +-- "bbb"                      logging.getLogger("a.a1.bbb")
   |    |
   |    +--- "b1"                           logging.getLogger("a.b1")
   |
   +-- "b"                                  logging.getLogger("b")

In this task, create and use a "mortgage.rate" logger instance inside the "get_current_rate()" function.
<br>
<br>
After you execute the task, you should notice this logger name is included with the log message.
