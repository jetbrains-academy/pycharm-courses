The logging module provides five logging levels. The levels allow you to control what messages are
included in the output stream.  Five levels is usually good for most applications, as having more levels just
leads to confusion about which level to use.
<br>
<br>
Each level is known by a constant (in all caps) and has a numeric value. The value comes into play when setting
a log level on a logger. Only messages at the logger's current logging level or greater is output.

<pre>LEVEL NAME         | FUNCTION                | VALUE
===================+=========================+==========
CRITICAL           | critical()              | 50
ERROR              | error()                 | 40
WARNING            | warning() or warn()     | 30
INFO               | info()                  | 20
DEBUG              | debug()                 | 10
