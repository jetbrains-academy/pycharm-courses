In our previous examples, we logged messages with different severity levels using helper functions such as logger.debug()
or logger.warning(). This is the easiest way to log messages.

<br>
If you need to dynamically change the log level (for example, escalate a warning to an error), then you can use
the Logger "log()" method which takes the level as the first argument.

In this task, replace the helper logging functions with the equivalent calls using Logger "log()".
