You can customize how each log message is output by specifying a format string.
<br>
<br>
This can be done by passing a "format" keyword argument to the "basicConfig" function.
<br>
<br>
The following format string will output the human readable datetime, the severity level and the log message.
<br>
'%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s'
<br>
<br>
In this task, pass this format string to the "basicConfig" function.
