When logging you should be aware of the type and size of data you might be logging.
<br>
<br>
If you have a value that could be very large, such as long string, you might want to limit the output, so you
don't make it difficult to look at your log output.
<br>
<br>
One simple way to do this with string values is to use the format specification ".NNs", where NN is the number of
characters to limit the string output. See the task for an example of this.
<br>
<br>
In some cases, you might want to truncate an object, but indicate that the object was truncated. The common
convention is to append the ellipses "..." to the end of the string to indicate there was more data. The following
example shows how you could create a helper function that uses string slicing to do this.

In this task, wrap the "big_list" object in a call to our "truncate()" helper function.
