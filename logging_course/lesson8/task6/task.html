Writing custom logging decorators can help you cut down on some boilerplate logging code.
<br>
<br>
In this example, we want to have our function "do_work" log when the function starts and finishes and also
include how long it took to execute.
<br>
<br>
We have written an example decorator for you.
<br>
<br>
1) Add the decorator to the "do_work" function
<br>
2) Set the appropriate log level to allow us to see the decorator results.
