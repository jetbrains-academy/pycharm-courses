In the previous task, disabling propagation on a handler in the hierarchy gave us a warning message, under Python 2.7.
We can explicitly silence this warning by adding a NullHandler handler object to the logger. This
handler does not output any log records. This will work with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.  NullHandler is not available
in Python 2.6 or earlier.
