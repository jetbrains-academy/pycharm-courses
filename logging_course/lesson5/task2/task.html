Filter objects can also perform in-place modification of LogRecord attributes. This can include changing values or
adding new attributes.

If you are developing a system that contains private user information, such as social security numbers, you should
take extra precautions to protect that data. That should include any log messages that might reference that private
data.
<br>
<br>
In this task, we have created a Filter which sanitizes (hides) U.S. social security numbers. This
is done by using a regular expression that searches for a given pattern. If it finds a match, that text is replaced with
a generic placeholder value (XXX-XX-XXXX).
<br>
<br>
1) A Filter should return a non-zero value if the log record should be passed to the handler or a 0 value if the filter
should exclude the record. Update the return value for the SanitizeSSNFilter object we have created.
<br>
<br>
2) Update the logging configuration to add this filter object to the root logger.
