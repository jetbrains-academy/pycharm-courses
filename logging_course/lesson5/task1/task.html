The Filter object allows fine grained control over what is included in the log output.
<br>
<br>
You add Filter objects to Loggers or Handlers using the addFilter() method. You can also have more than one filter attached to each object.
<br>
<br>
The LogRecord object for every log message is passed to the entire list of attached Filter objects. If a Filter
returns a 0 value, the LogRecord is dropped and no further processing is done.
<br>
<br>
The base Filter object filters based on a name in the module hierarchy. This usually is not very useful, therefore
you will more often see new Filters inheriting from the base Filter object and implement more unique behavior. There
are several examples of custom Filter objects in this course.
<br>
<br>
Filters when applied to Logger objects are only checked when you call a log method on that object in the hierarchy.
This is in contrast to Filters applied to Handler objects which are caller whenever a log record gets to the handler.
<br>
<br>
In this task, you can see how we have to add the Filter to each instance of our logger.
