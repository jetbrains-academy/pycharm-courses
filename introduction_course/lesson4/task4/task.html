Tuples are almost identical to lists. The only significant difference between tuples and lists is that tuples cannot be changed:
you cannot add, change, or delete elements from the tuple.
Tuples are constructed by a comma operator enclosed in parentheses, for example (a, b, c).
A single item tuple must have a trailing comma, such as (d,).
